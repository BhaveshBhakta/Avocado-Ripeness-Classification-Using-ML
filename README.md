## ü•ë Avocado Ripeness Classification

### üìå Project Overview

This project aims to classify the **ripeness of avocados** based on various physical characteristics such as firmness, hue, saturation, brightness, color category, sound (dB), weight, and size. The goal is to provide an automated method for determining avocado ripeness.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Highlights

  * **Dataset**: [Kaggle - Avocado Ripeness Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amldvvs/avocado-ripeness-classification-dataset)
  * **Size**: 250 entries, 9 columns
  * **Key Features**:
      * firmness, hue, saturation, brightness, color\_category, sound\_db, weight\_g, size\_cm3
  * **Approach**:
      * Exploratory Data Analysis (Histograms, Boxplots, Heatmaps)
      * Label Encoding for Categorical Features
      * Multi-class Classification (ripeness: `ripe`, `pre-conditioned`, `hard`, `breaking`, `firm-ripe`)
      * Models Used:
          * Logistic Regression, Ridge Classifier, SVC, Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Bagging, Decision Tree
  * **Best Accuracy**:
      * \~100% with Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Bagging, and Decision Tree.
      * \~90% with AdaBoost and SVC.

### üéØ Purpose and Applications

  * Automate the process of sorting avocados by ripeness for suppliers and retailers.
  * Assist consumers in selecting avocados at their preferred ripeness level.
  * Reduce food waste by optimizing inventory management based on ripeness predictions.
  * Support quality control in the agricultural industry.

### ü§ù Collaboration

We welcome contributions to improve the project. You can help by:

  * Improving model robustness via hyperparameter tuning.
  * Exploring advanced image-based classification techniques (if image data becomes available).
  * Adding explainability (e.g., SHAP or LIME) for model predictions.
  * Deploying the model via API or a user-friendly dashboard.
